Are you ready to push the boundaries of your automation skills? 

> We challenge you to build a fully autonomous train system capable of completing missions. 

You can use off-the-shelf parts and software, or you can take on the challenge of building everything from scratch. 

The more you build yourself, the bigger/more complex the train system is and the more goods you are able to transport: the more points you'll earn.

## Deliberate Practice

* Failling an attempt should be part of what we do here. Thi sis about experimentation and learning new things.
* This challenge combines multiple areas of expertise. Be aware it is impossible to 'know it all here' - Let alone 

## Core Challenges

Here are some of the challenges you'll need to overcome:

* Your system must be able to follow a predefined mission plan, such as moving specific between locations.
* Can your system handle the complexity of multiple trains running on the same track simultaneously?
* Advanced Switching: Implement automated switching
* Develop a system for moving predefined goods from point A to point B.
* Your system should be able to automatically detect and report failures.
* Will you use vendor-provided tracks or design and print your own for extra points?

## Possible Solutions

You have complete freedom in how you approach this challenge. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* The Foundation: You could start with a simple base, like a off the shelves Toy train and 2 Kids eager to find out how much they can achieve.
* Automation: Loading, Offloading, coordination of traffic - It wont take long and you will outlive the factory given options.
* Control Systems: Choose your preferred control system, whether it's the vendor's solution, an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi, or a custom-designed PCB.
* Software: Will you use off-the-shelf automation software, or will you write your own from the ground up?
* LLM Carnage: Have an LLM in control of functions in your contol center - A splendid way to demonstrate what a LLM can not do.

This is your chance to be creative, innovative, and to build something truly unique. We can't wait to see what you create
